# Artificial-Neural-Network-on-EEG-Dataset

Here is the Deep Learning methodology being used to train the model for seizure predictions. 
The Researchers, doctors have to work alot on the examinations of question/answer sessions or checking the patients with many kinds of technicalities.

There are many questions yet to be answered regarding the temporal/spatial characteristics of seizures from different pathologies, response to medication, 
effects on neurodevelopment and optimal detection. The dataset presented in this descriptor contains EEG recordings from human neonates, the visual interpretation 
of the EEG by the human experts, supporting clinical data and codes to assist access.

Dataset: https://physionet.org/content/chbmit/1.0.0/ 

Classification task was performed to predict and here we have got an output of perfectly trained model of 96% accuracy.
The seperately cropped files of seizure and non-seizure of chb01_03.edf has been used to train and predict the model accuracy. There we have achieved an accuracy of 97% on a mixed file of other seizure data.
